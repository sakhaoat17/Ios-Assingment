his SwiftUI app simulates a dice roll with an animated experience. The user taps the "Roll Dice" button to generate a random dice face between 1 and 6. The button temporarily disables as the dice “rolls,” cycling through random numbers to mimic a real rolling effect, before displaying the final result. The app provides a simple, engaging way to roll a virtual dice with smooth animations.
